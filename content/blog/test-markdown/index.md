This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on `some-javascript.js`.

Here is a block of code:

```sh
> echo "hello, world!"
> cd in for (try this);
```

```js
import React from "react"
import { Link } from "gatsby"

import { rhythm, scale } from "../utils/typography"

class Layout extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const { location, title, children } = this.props
    const rootPath = `${__PATH_PREFIX__}/`
    let header

    if (location.pathname === rootPath) {
      header = (
        <h1
          style={{
            ...scale(0.8),
            marginBottom: rhythm(1.5),
            marginTop: 0,
          }}
        >
          <Link
            style={{
              boxShadow: `none`,
              textDecoration: `none`,
              color: `inherit`,
            }}
            to={`/`}
          >
            {title}
          </Link>
        </h1>
      )
    } else {
      header = (
        <h3
          style={{
            marginTop: 0,
          }}
        >
          <Link
            style={{

              color: `inherit`,
            }}
            to={`/`}
          >
            {title}
          </Link>
        </h3>
      )
    }
    return (

          marginRight: `auto`,
          maxWidth: rhythm(24),
          padding: `${rhythm(1.5)} ${rhythm(3 / 4)}`,
        }}

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck

> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.
